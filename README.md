# QR Code Generator - Custom Hook Project

The aim of this project was to make your own qr code generator. It was pretty much do your own take on it, which was fun.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

It was to create a custom hooks for a qr code. The project was quite straight on, I used https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ to get the colors right and then i struggled a bt with the animation. But it was a fun way to wrap up all new things you learned this far. For this week one of the goals was to use a lottieanimation and also follow accessability guidelines, so my aim was to firt make the error messages pretty straughtforward but also, since I know some people struggle with understanding how to use the qr code I desiced that my animation should be one where the usage of the qr code was explained.
